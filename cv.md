## About
I have essential interpersonal and teamwork skills, which I have demonstrated working on my current workplace. Besides, I am a kind of person who really cares about deadlines and who is ready to adjust to any changes and challenges. This trait is one of the most useful outputs of the university.

And finally I want to say that I have a real desire to grow both professionally and personally, to learn more and develop my skills and qualities further, so I'm not afraid of any challenges and obstacles that can appear on my working way. If I don't know something, I can always learn it very fast!
